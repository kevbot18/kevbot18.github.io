		<h2>Loreum Ipsum</h2>
		<p>
			In IT the phrases “de jure” and “de facto” are closely related to, although technically not identical to their
			direct definitions.
			In IT the phrase “de jure” doesn’t directly mean “of law” because there are no “internet laws”, instead they are
			called standards and are enforced by standards bodies such as the IETF. A standard is just an official document
			outlining the minute details of how something works or should be implemented. By being a standard it must have
			passed through the relevant processes of the standards bodies, which involves bringing in many different people to
			vote on and revise parts of the soon-to-be standard. The process to becoming a standard is actually very similar to
			that of how a law is created in democratic societies, just substitute out Politicians. Much like the process to
			becoming a law, the process to formalizing a standard can take a long time as it involves requires input from all
			“interested parties” and prior implementation and testing of the standard so that it is complete and technically
			competent.
			On the other side are “de facto” or “in practice” “standards”. These are not formal standards that are enforced or
			that go through a standards body, but instead are simply commonly followed and used. This is typically the result of
			one company trying to push their proprietary offerings, the most notable example being Adobe’s FDF format.
